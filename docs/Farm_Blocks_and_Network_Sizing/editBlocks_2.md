    One can clear block data for selected routes, by using `Edit > Select Routes > Select SubRoutes` and starting `Workflow > Farm Blocks > Clear Block Data...` menu command.

    > **Useful Tips:** While hovering with a gripped vertex, press `DELETE` key to remove it, or hit `ENTER` key to add a new vertex before it.

3. Improved route sorting for Farm block area listing and tracking.
3. Flexible visualization, and management of blocks and their areas, allowing to list blocks only for selected routes and subroutes.

> **Important Note** It is recommended to use Host Objects to work with farm blocks, also when using layers to create them. 

   > **Tip:** Once Farmblocks are created, edited and hosted, use `Workflow > FarmBlocks > AutoCreate/Redraw...` menu command, and choose `Draw Only` option to visualize them. Right Click and choose `Farm Blocks` to toggle on/off the drawn Farm blocks.

Also, note that, if `Refresh Routes and Nodes` is selected, drawn farm blocks are not more in the data set, and attempt to toggle the farmblocks will fail.
