# Suggested Workflow for Farm Block creation and Management
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)

This tool is no more an experimental tool. It is now enhanced to allow vertex editing and flexible source/host management. In the light of this new tools, the following workflow is recommened.

1. **Create the blocks.** Decide which method -i.e., Automatic or AutoCAD method - to use to populate farm blocks to the network, and create them. Note, you can add more objects from AutoCAD drawin if needed (by layer, or individually).

    > Tip: When **Auto Creating** make sure a host object is not linked to the workspace. Otherwise hosted farmblocks in AutoCAD will be imported.

1. **Edit Blocks**. Delete unwanted blocks, and edit the vertices of those blocks whose extents overlap or need modification. Use available tools to create the best farm block collection.

    > When advanced editing is needed, use Host objects to export to AutoCAD, edit blocks, and update them back in CanalNETWORK environment.

    > Tip: **Recreate for Sub Routes.** If needed, subroutes can be selected/or displayed and the AutoCreator tool will draw the farm blocks for those canals only. Editing can also be done in this mode, and updated to AutoCAD. **Make sure layout views are NOT in sub-route mode.**


1. **Explore and Cummulate Areas:** Explore areas by subroutes. Cummulate Farm Areas, or RESET (raw, uncummulated) data, cummulate again, and iterate as needed.

1. **Size the network**, and continue to longitudinal design.
