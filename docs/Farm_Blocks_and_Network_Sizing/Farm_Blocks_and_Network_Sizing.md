# 5. Farm Blocks and Network Sizing
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)

One of the key strengths of CanalNETWORK software is high level of task automation avaiable for time consuming and error prone tasks. Once a network of canals is succesully imported and resolved, subsequent tasks are easy to manage, giving users a quick turnarround time for their projects. 

**Definition:** *Farm Block* is a term used to identify the net command area corresponding to the lowest generation of canals (Usually Quaternary or Field Canals) in a networked system.

**Definition:** *Hydraulic Sizing* refers to the determination of amount of discharge passing through each segment of each route of the network canals.

Tools for **farm block** analysis assist to accurately identify/map and calculate irrigation command areas for the lowest level(s) of canals in a given netowrk, and cummulate the values towards the first generation canals. Hydraulic sizing can then be determined accurately for the entire network by usinng the following relation ship.

<!---
$$Q_i= \sum Q_{i-1}+duty*A_i$$


Where
- $Q_i$ is the discharge capacity of a canal segment
- $Q_{i-1}$ is the capacity for the downstream segment
- duty is the command duty value for the canal generation in question (from design criteria), and
- $A_i$ is the area (in hactares) of land the canal is serving.

In this chapter, both farm blocks analysis (discussed in the first few sections), followed by network sizing tasks step by step. If you want to [Skip to Network Sizing Section](./Sizing.md/#sizing-networks), go ahead.
