## Important Notes about Manual Farm blocks
[Back to Top](#)

Farm blocks are expected to meet few requirements to be succesfully imported, and linked to, network of canals.

* All farm blocks must be made of polyline objects

* All farm blocks are expected to cross ONLY one canal route. This will not cause an error. However, In case of multiple intersections are found, the block area is associated with the route whose intersection is found first.

* It is highly recommended that they contain no Curved segments. FarmBlocks are imported as segments of straight lines, and hence all curve information will not be considered. This does not cause an error. However, it may lead to unwanted confusion regarding intersecting routes. Consider the below example.

Here, the Farm-block corresponding to SC_1 has a curve tracing the curve of the main canal (as shown in the highlighted area.) Upon import to network, the curve information is not considered, and the Farm block will have the geometry shown below.

As a result of removing the curve, the farm block now happens to cross not only the intended SC_1 route, but also MC. This may result in linking of farm block to MC, instead of SC_1. 

## Important Notes about AutoGenerated Blocks
[Back to Top](#)

If the AutoEstimate tool is used to create Farm Blocks, then it is key to note the following assumptions used in the software:

- Blocks are created for all canals who have EndOfCanal nodes associated with them. Typically these would be the lowest level or generation of canals in a network.

- The farm block created for a supply canal will attempt to follow the path of the canal, constrained by the neighbouring canals.

- For the last supply canal in a group, the farm block is created by using information from previous supply canal, and the alignment of the route itself. This is especially true, if the irrigation method is considered to be single side.

- The farm block creation can take one of two possible methods for a given parent route. Assuming a TC canal feeding to QC canals, a single side irrigation is assumed if the initial distance to the first QC canal is **less than 30m.** Other wise, a double side irrigation is assumed. This assumption is used when creating farmblocks for all the QC canals.

- The farmblocks are anlytically derived from the overall geometry of the layout system. Hence, constructed block areas may be **more** or **less** than actual. Use available in-line editing tools, or workflows to import/edit from AutoCAD, to refine results.

- Finally, **irregularly aligned routes** in network of canals could create unacceptable farmblocks. Consider the case show in below figure. The odd sized and shaped blocks are caused by the oddly positioned canal TC shown in red on the right (which does not have QCs, and hence needs a farm block.)

     As can be seen below, clean farm blocks are generated if this route is removed.

     Or, after creating QC canals for the TC as shown below.
