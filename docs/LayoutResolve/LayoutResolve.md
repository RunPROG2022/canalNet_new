# 4. Network Resolution
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)

**Definition:** Network Resolution is the process of creating an acceptable **connectivity** between all canal routes in the network, with out a **naming error**.
  

With ready to use data (see previous section), network analysis and resolution is the next step. Netowrk analysis and resolution is a critical step that influences all subsequent actions, including sizing, longitudinal deesign, and design production. This chapter covers below topics to outline the steps needed for a succesful network resolution.

A network of canals is considered resolved, when all elements of the network are connected and accurate naming is generated to each canal, with out errors. This involves the following steps:

1. Importing canal layout from AutoCAD
2. Node Identification, and processing
3. Naming style definition
4. Creating names
5. Ientifying and resolving issues. 

The following sections cover these topics.
