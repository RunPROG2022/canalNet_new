Table data are results of design work for a particular canal route that can be presented as a table listing. The following are typical table data that can be generated for a selected route.

## LSec Profile Data
[Back to Top](#)

LSec profile data is the detailed tabular presentation of station wise values for different analysis parameters. These are typical tables listing design levels, full supply levels, canal top levels, areas of cut and fill, and more. 

It is displayed from `Explore Solutions > Table Data > LSec Profile` menu command.

A sample table is shown below.

For more on this [see LSec Profile Data under the chapter Longitudinal Design of Routes](../LongDes/explore.md#lsec-profile-data)

## FLow Section Data
[Back to Top](#)

In a fully designed canal route, each segment adopts a specific hydraulic section for the corresponsing flow capacity, bed slope, and other paramters. These data can be accessed from the `Explore Solutions > Table Data > Flow Sections` menu command.

A sample table is shown below. The table lists all independent, and dependent variables in the standard canal sizing equations. These can be copied in to a report, or other documentations as needed.

## Schedule of Controls, Drops, Turnouts, and Division Boxes
[Back to Top](#)

There are similar table results available for controls and other structures from the same menu command group as above.

For each type of element, there are specific list of hydraulic properties (e.g., discharge) and structural properties (e.g, dimensions) are displayed. Learn more on the chapter on [Longitudinal Route Design](../LongDes/explore.md#exploring-controls) for each type of element.

See Exploring Solutions under Longitudinal Design of Canals Section, for details on each of these.
