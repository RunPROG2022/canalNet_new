# 9. Advanced Tools for Longitudinal Design
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)

## Introduction

In addition to tools and methods introduced in the [Longitudinal Design Chapter](../LongDes/LongDes.md) CanalNET comes with a number of features to conduct further analysis and design. These can be applied either to refine the designs completed using the previous set of tools, or explore additoinal components that are needed for optimal and fit-for-site project specific conditions.

The following are most frequently used:
- Automatic vertical design
- Best hydraulic section determination
- Over-riding design criteria
- Alternate route alignment
- Special structures

... and more.
