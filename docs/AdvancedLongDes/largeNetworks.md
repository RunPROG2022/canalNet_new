# Working with Large Networks
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)


Working with large netwroks can pose some challenges when dealing with farm blocks creation. This can be easily solved using the sub-network view feature. This feature limits the displayed network to all branches of a given route. There are two ways to start this function.

1. Go to `View > Sub-Network` menu. The first time, the list contains only one item, Click on the `Re-create Sub Networks` item. This will analyze and group your network in hirarchies.

   To view this, restart the command again. You will now see a list of items, and sub items.

   Click on any one item, only the corresponding routes will be displayed.

2. The other method is to use `View > Go to Route...` menu or `Ctrl+G` for short. Select the desired route on plan view, and start the command.

   Accept OK on the dialog, and this will retain only relevant canal routes in the view.

You can work on any sub-network, as you would on the entire network. The changes will only affect the network in view.
