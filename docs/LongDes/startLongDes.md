# Start Longitudinal Design
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)

There are two ways to start the longitudinal design of a canal route:

1. In the plan view, zoom or pan to the desired roure, and left-click on it. 
   
   Note: Right click does not load the profile data to the profile view axis.
   
   Note: Make sure the Multi-Select option is diabled, in `Edit > Multi-Select` or the toolbar button. 

2. Press `Ctrl+K` or go to `Workspace > Pick Route (AutoCAD`),

Both options load and render longitudinal profile data, along with canal controls and flow profile information to the Profile view axis. 

> Note: The longitudinal design task follows a down-stream design approach, that is componenets of the route, including controls, drops, and segment assembly information, are positioned and designed from upstream end to downstream end.

The user can interact with the design in many ways, including:

- Adjusting control inverts
- Adjustin and managing Vertical Drops
- Refine canal assembly information
- Exploring solutions

... and more.
