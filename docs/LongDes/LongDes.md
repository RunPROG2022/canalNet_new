# 6. Longitudinal Route Design
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)

## Introduction

Longitudinal design of routes is the stage where the engineer spends significant time working on individual canal routes, and exploring design scenarios. CanalNET offers an interactive graphic environment with rich annotation to guide design process effectively.

This section introduces to the tools, visualizations, and production ready design outputs.

**Note:** The terms *Vertical Design* and *Longitudinal Design* are used interchangeably.

## Pre-requisits

Longitudinal design stage requires that the below workflow tasks are completed adequatedly:

1. Resolved network 

2. Established network

3. Profile extracted (covered in this chapter)

Profile extraction can be handled in iCAD or CanalNET. In either case, the data must be brought to the CanalNET workspace from `Workflow > Routes > Soft Reload` menu command.

> **Note**: Recent versions of CanalNET detect short canals (typically less than 100meters), and extract finer resolution of incremental distance (5m) to have enough data for longitudinal design. CanalNET does not load alignment routes shorter than 20 meters by default.

Once the above stages are complete, and data from each is accessible (See here for available ways to manage different data and make them accessible for CanalNETWORK), longitudinal profile design can continue.
