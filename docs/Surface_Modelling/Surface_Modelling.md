# 7. Topographic Data and Alignment Profiles
[Back to Home](../index.md#wellcome)

Topographic data is one of the three key input data required to use CanalNET in project design worlkflws, among layout maps and design criteria. It is used in generating profile data along with locaation information, to give spatial context to the engineers' task at various stages. This section introduces the methods and steps to prepare, host and avail such data in CanalNET workspace.

>**Note:** The terms *Surface Data* and *Topographic Data* or *Topo Data* are used interchangeably in this chapter.

> :bulb: **Important Note**: For this section, we strongly recommend to read documentation for iCAD product under the same heading. It provides a more detailed and comprhensive information that is up to date. The pricniples and algorithms are essentially the same. Here, the focus will be on CanalNET specific use cases.

## Data Preparation
[Back to Top](#)

Data input for topographic data (i.e., surface data) is expected in .*CSV (comma separated value) format as shown below. Please read the section on [Data Preparation](../Data%20Preparation/Data%20Preparation.md) for more details.

CanalNET uses such data for profile extraction, alignment detection and querry functions.
